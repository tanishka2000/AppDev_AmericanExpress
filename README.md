PROBLEM STATEMENT


Social bookmarking systems have recently gained interest among researchers in the areas of data mining and web intelligence, as they provide a vast amount of user-generated annotations and reflect the interests of millions of people.
ABC Bank is a FinTech bank that aims to enhance the customer experience and would like to use/analyse the public data available on various social bookmarking sites (like twitter, reddit etc.) for this purpose. Some of the important datasets they would like to analyse to find out how user sentiment is trending on social media are customer comments about (not just limited to!)-

1. Their payment experience using credit cards e.g. Were they able to make the payment using the credit card, overall availability of payment services.
2. Mobile based payment solutions across various platforms e.g. What do their customers think about these solutions, the ease/speed of transactions, success rate.
3. Special offers/discounts, cashbacks, loyalty points on the credit cards

The bank is looking at solutions that can help them best collate and infer processes they should continue, improve, invest and innovate.
